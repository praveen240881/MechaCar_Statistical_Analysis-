This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### DELIVERABLE 1 ###
# Import the data
mecha_car_mpg <- read.csv(file='R_Analysis/MechaCar_mpg.csv',check.names = F, stringsAsFactors = F)

# Perform linear regression that predicts the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, mecha_car_mpg)
summary(lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, mecha_car_mpg))
# p-value: 5.35e-11
# r-squared: 0.6825


### DELIVERABLE 2 ###
# Import the data
sus_coil <- read.csv(file='R_Analysis/Suspension_Coil.csv', check.names = F, stringsAsFactors = F)
# Create a summary data frame
total_summary <- sus_coil %>% summarize(Mean = mean(PSI), Median = median(PSI), Variance = var(PSI), SD = sd(PSI))
# Create a summary data frame grouped by Manufacturing Lot
lot_summary <- sus_coil %>% group_by(Manufacturing_Lot) %>% summarize(Mean = mean(PSI), Median = median(PSI),Variance = var(PSI), SD = sd(PSI))




### DELIVERABLE 3 ###
# Determine if the PSI across all manufacturing lots is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch
t.test(sus_coil$PSI, mu = 1500)

# Determine if the PSI for each manufacturing lot is statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch
Lot1 = subset(sus_coil, Manufacturing_Lot == 'Lot1')
Lot2 = subset(sus_coil, Manufacturing_Lot == 'Lot2')
Lot3 = subset(sus_coil, Manufacturing_Lot == 'Lot3')

t.test(Lot1$PSI, mu = 1500) 
# p-value = 1
t.test(Lot2$PSI, mu = 1500)
# p-value = 0.6072
t.test(Lot3$PSI, mu = 1500)
# p-value = 0.04168
